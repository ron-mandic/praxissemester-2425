and Kim\\nIn the back of the club, kissin a boy that aint him\\nOkay, you need to be alone\\nAnd if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone\\nI just thought I would tell you, cause you oughta

lacks the melanin\\nGive me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in\\nDo it for the hell of it\\nCause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit\\nI took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image\\nPut in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick\\nThe fact is this, Ill end up dating actresses\\nWake up on dirty mattresses, I think Ill need to practice this\\nBut I make shit happen, call me a laxative\\nWorlds on my shoulders, I dont even know what Atlas is\\nHard bars sharp like a cactus is\\nIm back to rapping, back to back cause Ive been

to run in those unbuckled shells\\nOne microphone and a couple 12s\\nSix drum sounds and a couple bells\\nIs all you had to make a couple rails\\nAnd thats a track, and if you want a \\nYou have to

to stay\\nBut its safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight\\nAt 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home\\nI was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked\\nAnd went from sleeping at a subway station\\nTo sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population\\nNot my imagination, I dont wanna relax\\nWould it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?

that I handle it wrong\\nBut then Ive never had an enemy except the NME\\nBut Ill be selling twice as many copies as their magazinesll ever be\\nWith only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees\\nAre healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree\\nSinging for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids\\nI keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic\\nIm battling for respect, and I dont know

lyrics and a melody could be written\\nNow absence can make your heart ache\\nBut drinking Absinthe can change your mind state\\nVividly, need to let my liver be\\nAnd Ill say it again, living life on
